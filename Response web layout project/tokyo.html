            <h1>Tokyo</h1>
            <p>Encircled by stone-walled moats and broad gardens, the Imperial Palace, the home of the emperor of Japan, lies at the heart of the city. East of and adjacent to the Imperial Palace is the colourful Marunouchi district, the financial hub and a major centre of Japanese business activity. South of the palace is the Kasumigaseki district, containing many national government offices. West of that is Nagatacho, where the National Diet Building (parliament) is located. Tokyo has no single central business district, but the city is dotted with urban centres, usually around railroad stations, where department stores, shops, hotels, office buildings, and restaurants are clustered. In between are less intensively developed neighbourhoods with similar mixtures. The buildings in these districts range from stone and brick structures of the Meiji period (1868–1912) to postwar concrete and steel skyscrapers; there are also a dwindling number of wooden, Japanese-style buildings. The brightly lit Ginza shopping district, located in the eastern part of the central city, is world renowned. Northeast of the Imperial Palace, the Kanda district is noted for its many universities, bookstores, and publishers. Although Tokyo’s parks are not as large as those in some major American or European cities, they are numerous and often contain exquisite Japanese gardens.
